# Project-Generator

Ever found yourself staring at a blank screen, desperate for a data project idea that actually shows off your skills? Trust me, I’ve been there. That’s why I created the **Project-Generator**. It’s a tool built for data folks like us—analysts, scientists, engineers—who want project ideas that feel fresh, relevant, and fun. Using a bit of AI magic, it takes your job title, favorite tools, and industry, then whips up personalized project suggestions complete with details, timelines, and skills graphs to help you bring them to life.

## Why You’ll Love It

Here’s what makes this tool special:

- **AI-Powered Ideas**: Say goodbye to brainstorming burnout. Pop in your details, and watch the ideas roll in.
- **Deep Dives**: Each project comes with a breakdown—like a friend walking you through the problem and the techy bits.
- **Visual Goodies**: Timelines and skills graphs make planning less of a chore and more of a “wow.”
- **Save & Export**: Keep your favorites handy and share them easily.
- **Smooth Experience**: Built with Streamlit, so it’s as user-friendly as it gets.

## Getting Started

Setting this up is pretty simple, but if you stumble, don’t sweat it—I’m here to help! Just follow these steps:

1. **Grab the Code**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/komallande/Project-Generator.git
   cd Project-Generator
   ```

2. **Set Up a Virtual Space** (optional, but it’s a good habit):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install the Good Stuff**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Add Your API Key**:
   - Make a `.env` file in the main folder.
   - Add this line with your Google API key:
     ```
     GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
     ```

5. **Fire It Up**:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```
